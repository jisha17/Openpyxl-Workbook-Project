# Openpyxl-Workbook-Project

Have created a self project of Openpyxl. Created excel with 3 sheets. Inserted/Write data in each cell by giving font,cell colour,border and aligned each cell. It is a very basic program using python Openpyrl package. I have also uploaded the excel which was created using given program.
The program is divided into two parts
1. Create Workbook and sheets- Creates a workbook with three sheets named in it.
2.Writting and formatting sheets- Used the created sheet to insert all datas in side the cell by formaating all entered cell.

This program is developed in jupyter notebook using python
